# Household Harmful Objects Detection Convolutional Neural Network

## Introduction

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to detect harmful objects in a household environment. The model is trained to identify a variety of objects that can pose potential risks to individuals in a home setting, such as sharp objects, poisonous substances, and more.

## Dataset

The CNN is trained on a custom dataset of household images that contain both harmful and non-harmful objects. The dataset consists of annotated images that help the model learn to differentiate between objects. The dataset is not included in this repository, but it can be collected and preprocessed according to your specific needs.
